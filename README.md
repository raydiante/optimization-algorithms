# Getting started
The files .dat are database used in the algorithms that represents the graph. The second and third lines represents the nodes and links respectively. The subsequent lines describe those relations.
# 1) grasp.py
The greedy randomized adaptive search procedure, known as GRASP, is a metaheuristic algorithm commonly applied to combinatorial optimization problems.
# 2) simulatedannealing.py
Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. 
# 3) vns-kcaed3.py
Variable neighborhood search (VNS) is a metaheuristic method for solving a set of combinatorial optimization and global optimization problems. It explores distant neighborhoods of the current incumbent solution, and moves from there to a new one if and only if an improvement was made.
The algorithm uses k-cardinality tree.
# 4) tabu.py
Tabu search is a metaheuristic search method employing local search methods used for mathematical optimization.
Local (neighborhood) searches take a potential solution to a problem and check its immediate neighbors in the hope of finding an improved solution. 
# 5) genetico2.py
The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the genetic algorithm selects individuals at random from the current population to be parents and uses them to produce the children for the next generation. 
# 6) metaheuristica.py
Uses two Metaheuristic described above, one as a constructor (grasp) and another one to search for the best output (vns).
